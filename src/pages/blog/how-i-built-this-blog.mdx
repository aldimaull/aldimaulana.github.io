I built this blog using Astro, React, Material Symbols, Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Markdown, and MDX.

### What tools i use in this blog?

#### Astro
Astro is a modern web framework that makes it easy to build static websites and Jamstack applications. It's great for building blogs because it's fast, lightweight, and easy to use.

#### React.js
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's great for building interactive components for your blog, like blog post previews, comment sections, and search bars.

#### Material Symbols
Material Symbols is a library of vector icons that can be used in your blog. It's great for adding visual flair to your blog without having to worry about designing your own icons.

#### Vanilla JavaScript
Vanilla JavaScript is the basic form of JavaScript that doesn't rely on any third-party libraries. It's great for adding custom functionality to your blog that isn't available in Astro or React.

#### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your blog. It's great for building responsive and beautiful blogs without having to write a lot of CSS.

#### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's great for writing blog posts. It's easy to learn and use, and it can be easily converted to HTML.

#### MDX
MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to embed React components in your blog posts. This makes it easy to create interactive and dynamic blog posts.

### Setting up development environment

Here are the steps I took to build this blog:
I used VS Code as my code editor and Node.js as my development environment.

1. Install Astro. I used the following command to install Astro:<br/>```npm install -g astro```
2. Create a new Astro project. I used the following command to create a new Astro project:<br/>```astro new my-blog```
3. Add React. I used the following command to add React to my Astro project:
<br/>```npm install @astrojs/renderer-react```
4. Add Material Symbols. I used the following command to add Material Symbols to my Astro project:<br/>```npm install @material/icons```
5. Add Tailwind CSS. I used the following command to add Tailwind CSS to my Astro project:<br/>```npm install tailwindcss```
6. Add Markdown and MDX. I used the following command to add Markdown and MDX to my Astro project:<br/>```npm install @astrojs/plugin-mdx```

Start developing! Once I had all of my dependencies installed, I was ready to start developing my blog. I started by creating a few pages, like a home page, a blog post page, and a contact page. I also added some blog posts using Markdown and MDX. After that, once I was happy with my blog, i deploy the blog. I deployed it to Vercel app. Vercel is a great hosting service for static websites.
